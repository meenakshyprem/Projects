RAINFALL_EDA
The rainfall project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine weather patterns across various locations, focusing on metrics such as rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and humidity at different times of the day and so on. By analyzing these factors, the project aims to identify trends and correlations, such as locations prone to heavy rainfall or high humidity, which can inform weather prediction and risk assessment.
